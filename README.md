**Recipe Recommendation System (NLP)**

This project implements a recipe recommendation system based on classical NLP techniques.

- Recommendation system based on **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity** — the user provides a list of ingredients and the model returns the most relevant recipes.
- **Text preprocessing** (normalization, special character removal), vector-based document representation, and similarity ranking.
- **CLI interface (argparse)** for easy execution from the command line.
- **Model evaluation** using ranking-based metrics (**MRR**, top-5 accuracy).
- Designed for further extension with **SBERT embeddings** or sequential models.
